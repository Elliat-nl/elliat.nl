## Martin Middel â–» JavaScript XML Developer

Hey there! I am *Martin Middel*. I am an experienced independent JavaScript / XML developer for
hire. I am currently involved with [Jinntec](jinntec.de) and in Fonto consultancy for various
partners.

I have 11 years of experience with [Fonto](fontoxml.com). Growing from a core developer to the
developer advocate. Helping partners making the best Fonto configuration possible! As an independent
developer I can also help you with your Fonto configuration (or anything touching anything
XML). Just send a mail to [inquiries@elliat.nl](mailto:inquiries@elliat.nl) and I'll get back to
you! Or reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinmiddel/)!

You might have seen me at XML conferences: [here in
2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fRoqUG7o70), [here in
2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUwjQ3yqPyM) and here in
[2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoeADE-9MIg). If you have not, you can hear my voice there!

I am deeply involved in the development of [FontoXPath](https://github.com/fontoxml/fontoxpath), the
best free open source XPath 3.1 implementation that runs in the browser! [Contact
me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinmiddel/) if you'd like me to help you out with developing with
JavaScript and XML, or Fonto and FontoXPath specifically!

Some useful links I have accumulated over the years:

* [The XPath playground](https://xpath.playground.fontoxml.com/). Run XPaths in here!
* [Entry point to DITA element documentation](https://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.1/OS/langspec/langref/topic.html) cause I usually forget it
* [How to configure Fonto](https://vimeo.com/932811538/e66da92825). A video series on how to set up Fonto from scratch.

A hand of the schemas I have worked with over the years:

* DITA, including architecting specializations and DITA-OT plugins
* TEI
* Docbook
* XBRL
* JATS
